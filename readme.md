## what is the purpose of this repository?

The objective of this repository is to gather information about me in a single web page, such as links to my profiles on social networks, information to contact, a blog to share ideas about programming and development (coming soon) and mainly promote my projects and my contributions in the open source community. Do not need to explain why I chose GitHub for it =D
